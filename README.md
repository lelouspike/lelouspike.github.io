## Welcome to Lelou's Homepage

I am Lelou, you can define me as anyone or anything you wish to define as.

Well, I also have another Github account TeddyRemusLupin for my assigns. The Prof. requires everyone to set up the github. io page as an assign. So I created this one.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lelouspike/lelouspike.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
